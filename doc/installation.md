# Ubuntu 14.04 LTS Installation

Installation of devices on Linux is lengthy compared to Windows or OSX due to the fact an updated kernel must be installed and the core uvcvideo driver patched with support for additional pixel formats provided by RealSenseâ„¢ cameras. 

**Note:** Several scripts below invoke `wget, git, add-apt-repository` which may be blocked by your IT firewall resulting in timeouts and errors. Add necessary proxy settings to config files or append scripts with appropriate switches. 

1. Ensure apt-get is up to date
  * `sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade`
2. Install libusb-1.0 via apt-get
  * `sudo apt-get install libusb-1.0-0-dev`
3. glfw3 is not available in apt-get on Ubuntu 14.04. Use included installer script:
  * `scripts/install_glfw3.sh`
4. **Follow the installation instructions for your desired backend (see below)**
5. We use QtCreator as an IDE for Linux development on Ubuntu
  * **Note:** QtCreator is presently configured to use the V4L2 backend by default
  * `sudo apt-get install qtcreator`
  * `sudo scripts/install_qt.sh` (we also need qmake from the full qt5 distribution)
  * `all.pro` contains librealsense and all example applications
  * From the QtCreator top menu: Clean => Run QMake => Build
  * Built QtCreator projects will be placed into `./bin/debug` or `./bin/release`
6. We also provide a makefile if you''d prefer to use your own favorite text editor
  * `make && sudo make install`
  * The example executables will build into `./bin`

## Video4Linux backend

1. Ensure no cameras are presently plugged into the system.
2. Install udev rules 
  * `sudo cp config/99-realsense-libusb.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/`
  * Reboot or run `sudo udevadm control --reload-rules && udevadm trigger` to enforce the new udev rules
3. Next, choose one of the following subheadings based on desired machine configuration / kernel version (and remember to complete step 4 after). **Note: ** Multi-camera support is currently NOT supported on 3.19.xx kernels. Please update to 4.4 stable. 
  * **Updated 4.4 Stable Kernel** (recommended)
    * Run the following script to install necessary dependencies (GCC 4.9 compiler and openssl) and update kernel to v4.4-wily
      * `./scripts/install_dependencies-4.4.sh`
    * Run the following script to patch uvcvideo.ko
      * `./scripts/patch-uvcvideo-4.4.sh v4.4-wily` (note the argument provided to this version of the script)
      * This script involves shallow cloning the Linux source repository (100mb), and may take a while
  * **(OR) Stock 3.19.xx Kernel in 14.04.xx** 
    * Run the following script to patch uvcvideo.ko
      * `./scripts/patch-uvcvideo-3.19.sh`
    * (R200 Only) Install connectivity workaround
      * `./scripts/install-r200-udev-fix.sh`
      * This udev fix is not necessary for kernels >= 4.2.3
4. Reload the uvcvideo driver
  * `sudo modprobe uvcvideo`

## LibUVC backend

**Note:** This backend has been deprecated on Linux.

The libuvc backend requires that the default linux uvcvideo.ko driver be unloaded before libusb can touch the device. This is because uvcvideo will own a UVC device the moment is is plugged in; user-space applications do not have permission to access the devie handle. See below regarding the udev rule workaround. 

The libuvc backend has known incompatibilities with some versions of SR300 and R200 firmware (1.0.71.xx series of firmwares are problematic). 

1. Grant appropriate permissions to detach the kernel UVC driver when a device is plugged in:
  * `sudo cp config/99-realsense-libusb.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/`
  * `sudo cp config/uvc.conf /etc/modprobe.d/`
  * Either reboot or run `sudo udevadm control --reload-rules && udevadm trigger` to enforce the new udev rules
2. Use the makefile to build the LibUVC backend
  * `make BACKEND=LIBUVC`
  * `sudo make install`

# Apple OSX Installation  

1. Install XCode 6.0+ via the AppStore
2. Install the Homebrew package manager via terminal - [link](http://brew.sh/)
3. Install libusb via brew:
  * `brew install libusb`
4. Install glfw3 via brew:
  * `brew install homebrew/versions/glfw3`

---

# Windows 8.1 Installation

librealsense should compile out of the box with Visual Studio 2013 Release 5. Particular C++11 features are known to be incompatible with earlier VS2013 releases due to internal compiler errors. GLFW is provided in the solution as a NuGet package.

librealsense has not been tested with Visual Studio Community Edition.
